# Frontend - Trivia API

## Getting Setup

> _**NB**_: This frontend is designed to work with the [Trivia Backend Api](https://github.com/eca-kubi/trivia-api-backend). You must **stand up the backend first**, to integrate smoothly.

### Features
The app will let you
1. List all questions (paginated) fetched from the backend
2. Search questions using a search term
3. Delete questions
4. Fetch questions based on category
5. Play a quiz

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Installing Node and NPM:**
   This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). You must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Installing project dependencies:**
   If you have NPM already installed, point your terminal to the `frontend` directory of this repository where the package.json file is located. 
3. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```
>**_NB_: The UI is built with the [React library](https://reactjs.org/)**
